# Anchoring Bias Research

A collection of research findings, experimental data, and practical examples demonstrating the anchoring bias in negotiations, pricing, estimations, and everyday decision-making. This repository serves as a resource for researchers, negotiators, and anyone interested in understanding how initial reference points shape our judgments.

## Understanding Anchoring Bias

Anchoring bias is one of the most robust and well-documented cognitive biases in behavioral science. First described by Tversky and Kahneman in 1974, anchoring occurs when people rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter (the "anchor") when making subsequent judgments or decisions.

The effect is remarkably powerful. Even when anchors are obviously arbitrary or irrelevant, they still exert a measurable influence on estimates and decisions. In one classic experiment, participants who spun a wheel that landed on a high number gave significantly higher estimates for the percentage of African countries in the United Nations than those whose wheel landed on a low number, despite the wheel being completely random.

Understanding anchoring is essential for anyone who wants to make better decisions. [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) provides frameworks for recognizing and counteracting cognitive biases like anchoring in your daily decision-making process.

## Research Areas Covered

### Anchoring in Negotiations
Negotiation research consistently shows that the first offer serves as a powerful anchor. The party that makes the first offer often achieves better outcomes because subsequent counteroffers tend to cluster around that initial figure. This repository includes summaries of key studies on first-offer effects, counter-anchoring strategies, and the role of aspiration prices in negotiation outcomes.

### Anchoring in Pricing and Marketing
Retailers and marketers have long exploited anchoring effects. Showing a higher "original" price next to a sale price makes the discount appear more attractive, even when the original price was artificially inflated. This section examines research on price anchoring, decoy pricing, and how reference prices shape consumer perceptions of value.

### Anchoring in Estimation Tasks
When people estimate quantities, durations, or probabilities, their estimates are systematically biased toward whatever anchor they have been exposed to. This affects everything from project timeline estimation in software development to sentencing decisions in courtrooms.

### Anchoring in Financial Markets
Market anchoring occurs when investors fixate on specific price levels, such as a stock's 52-week high or the price at which they purchased a security. This section reviews research on how anchoring contributes to market anomalies and suboptimal investment decisions.

## Key Findings

- Anchoring effects persist even when participants are warned about the bias
- Expertise reduces but does not eliminate anchoring effects
- The strength of anchoring increases with cognitive load and time pressure
- Self-generated anchors can be as influential as externally provided ones
- Anchoring affects both novices and experts across virtually every domain studied

## Debiasing Strategies

Completely eliminating anchoring bias is extremely difficult, but several strategies can reduce its impact:

1. **Consider the Opposite**: Actively generate reasons why the anchor might be wrong
2. **Use Multiple Anchors**: Expose yourself to several reference points rather than fixating on one
3. **Establish Pre-Commitment Rules**: Decide on your criteria before encountering any anchors
4. **Seek Objective Data**: Ground your estimates in base rates and historical data rather than salient reference points
5. **Build Decision Rules**: Create systematic frameworks that reduce reliance on any single piece of information

## Practical Applications

Understanding anchoring bias has immediate practical value. Whether you are negotiating a salary, setting prices for your products, estimating project timelines, or evaluating investment opportunities, awareness of anchoring effects can help you make more accurate judgments and avoid being manipulated by others' strategic use of anchors.

The most effective defense against anchoring is building systematic decision processes that rely on pre-established criteria rather than ad hoc judgments influenced by whatever information happens to be most salient. Resources like [KeepRule](https://keeprule.com) can help you develop these systematic approaches to decision-making.
